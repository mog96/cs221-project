| PROPOSAL OUTLINE |
+------------------+

TASK DEFINITION
  - Draw a looping (complete circle) wavy line. Achieve balance between order and chaos that yields beauty as observed by a human

INFRASTRUCTURE
  - Processing in Python

APPROACH
  - Model as search problem
    - States are points in a grid (graph)
    - Decision of where next line segment should be drawn is based on some heuristic

  - Baseline: Create a line that touches all dots
  - Oracle: Create a line that touches all dots and forms a loop

LITERATURE REVIEW
  - Procedural graph generation (for creating wavy lines)

ERROR ANALYSIS
  - [ Design a few experiments to show the properties (both pros and cons) of your system. For example, if your system is supposed to deal with graphs with lots of cycles, then construct both examples with lots of cycles and ones without to test your hypothesis. ]

PERCY'S FEEDBACK 10/23:
  - This is a search problem
  - Constraints should be between filling the whole rectangle with the line and making an interesting pattern (which he supposes is at odds with trying to fill the whole rectangle)
  - Oracle is one of my drawings
  - Baseline is basic whole rectangle/basic interesting line that does not fill rectangle

| IDEAS FOR COMPOSITION |
+-----------------------+

PARAMETERS TO TUNE
  - Compose drawing into polygonal cells
    - Each is filled before moving on to an adjacent polygon
    - Polygons could be composed ahead of time or composed as line is drawn, with constraints on their size
      - Requirement perhaps is that at least two/three corners must touch corners of nearby polygons
